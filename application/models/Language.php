/**
 * This model class represents the business logic associated with a "guestbook"
 * model.  While its easy to say that models are generally derived from
 * database tables, this is not always the case.  Data sources for models are
 * commonly web services, the filesystem, caching systems, and more.  That
 * said, for the purposes of this guestbook applicaiton, we have split the
 * buisness logic from its datasource (the dbTable).
 *
 * This particular class follows the Table Module pattern.  There are other
 * patterns you might want to employ when modeling for your application, but
 * for the purposes of this example application, this is the best choice.
 * To understand different Modeling Paradigms:
